# Tortoise --Redmine-- OpenProject Plugin

## Important Note

This project is a fork from the Redmine plugin. Not every aspect (not even in this readme) is updated yet to reflect the changes!

For now to download the installer please do so from downloads folder in the project source.

## Introduction

**TurtleMine** provides a plugin for Tortoise SVN/GIT/Hg for [Redmine issue tracking](http://www.redmine.org).

Once this plugin is installed and configured you will have a new button in your TortoiseSVN/GIT/Hg commit window that will give you direct access to a list of Redmine issues that you can select to include in your commit message.

Additional features can be found in some of the sites wiki pages (see the wiki folder in the project source).

## Current Versions

| TurtleMine | 1.2.0.1 - 32bit | March 3 2012 |

## Note from the developer

The next release (unless there is a need for a bug fix release) will be version 2.0.0.1 and will contain a separate UI to assist in configuration and provide more options and lots of new features. Thanks for your patience.
